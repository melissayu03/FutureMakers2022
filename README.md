# FutureMakers2022

Day 1 - Starting off day one of the MIT Surestart machine learning and AI program was fun. I got to meet my teammates and get a little lesson/overview on the basics of python. On Day 1 of the homework, I struggled with a couple of questions because I am quite new to python as I only learned the basics by myself about a week ago. I hope by the end of this program, I can create something great out of python and be able to go back and know how to solve those programs.


Day 2- Today was a day of learning concepts that were completly new to me and it was interesting and challenging to be introduced to these new topics. I got to learn the differen fundementals of machine learning and even though today's homework was slighty confusing, I think the more I read and researched, the more I got to understand the concepts we learned today. 


Day 3- I got to learn a lot of new concepts today and particulary about machine learning. In the homework, I was introduced to different machine learning models and different patterns that I might come across in the future. I was also introduced to a little bit of tensorflow and after today I realized I have so much left to learn. 


Day 4- Today we got to attend a seminar with Dr.David Kong who taught us the significance of story-telling and how it can really have an impact on other readers/your audience. I really enjoyed getting to attend this seminar and it was really fun to hear everyone's origin stories as well as share my own. It was very easy to be engaged because Mr.Kong made it really interactive and fun. I am very inspired after today seminar.
