# FutureMakers2022

Day 1 - Starting off day one of the MIT Surestart machine learning and AI program was fun. I got to meet my teammates and get a little lesson/overview on the basics of python. On Day 1 of the homework, I struggled with a couple of questions because I am quite new to python as I only learned the basics by myself about a week ago. I hope by the end of this program, I can create something great out of python and be able to go back and know how to solve those programs.

Day 2- Today was a day of learning concepts that were completly new to me and it was interesting and challenging to be introduced to these new topics. I got to learn the differen fundementals of machine learning and even though today's homework was slighty confusing, I think the more I read and researched, the more I got to understand the concepts we learned today. 

Day 3- I got to learn a lot of new concepts today and particulary about machine learning. In the homework, I was introduced to different machine learning models and different patterns that I might come across in the future. I was also introduced to a little bit of tensorflow and after today I realized I have so much left to learn. 

Day 4- Today we got to attend a seminar with Dr.David Kong who taught us the significance of story-telling and how it can really have an impact on other readers/your audience. I really enjoyed getting to attend this seminar and it was really fun to hear everyone's origin stories as well as share my own. It was very easy to be engaged because Mr.Kong made it really interactive and fun. I am very inspired after today seminar. 

Day 5- I got to explore more about the new concepts of machine learning, specifically more about neural networks which was very exciting. I got to learn about tensorflow in the homework and I was eager to learn about why and when we use tensorflow. I got to see how neural networks process information and what the output would be. We also got to attend a technical talk today which introduced a different mindset and gave me inspiration. 

Day 6- Today we got to learn more about neural networks and different things like parameters, sigmoid vs softmax, forward and backward passes, etc. We talked about the different layers of a neural network and how to encorporate weight. There was more math presented in today and I'm definetly more challenged as I continue to learn. 

Day 7- I got to learn a lot more about neural networks today and things are for sure getting challenging! There are so many different type of neural networks such as convolution neural networks and Artificial neural networks that handels information differently and processes information differently. I learned quite a lot from today's lesson. We also got to attend a technical talk about setting a goal and completing the steps to acheive that goal. 

Day 8- Today we learned about a new concept called algorithmic bias, which explains how even a computer/computational thinking can also be biased. It was really suprising to learn that computers can be bias but in the end of the lesson it made sense on why. We also attended another relfection session today which refreshed my mind on the 4 steps of computational thinking and how the skills we are learning can apply to my future. 

Day 9- I learned more about the components of Convolutional neural networks today we got to continue donut workshopping with our peers. I learned about the MNIST dataset today and also more about how filters work with different channels/images. I also got to learn about dropout layers and batch normalizing layers. 

Day 10- Today was a little bit more challenging as we learned about loss functions, there are different types of loss functions and many errors you can run into when creating loss functions. Today was more math-based so I definitely needed to go over the slides a couple times before I grasped a good understanding of the new information. 

Day 11- Today we learned about activation fucntions and the many different types of activation functions that exist. We went over the functions mathematically and then coded them which I thought was really helpful because I got to see what the functions did. As we're getting closer to the create-a-thon, my team is starting to gather ideas. 

Day 12- We dived into more information about biases and the different types of biases in machines learning which was nice because I got to review and explore more on how machines can be bias. We got introduced to the idea of ethics today and how diversity connects to that. In addition, we also got to attend another technical talk and even though I have no intrest in crytocurrency what-so-ever, it was refreshing to see someone with so much energy and determination in the tech field and also learn about such a new topic. 

Day 13- Image classfication was our new topic today and the colab notebook was a bit harder today. We attended another reflection session today and did another survey. Lastly, we attended a seminar about webscrapping which involved interactive live coding and I learn a lot from this. 

Day 14- First day of the last week of content! Today we learned more and got into more depth with overfitting/underfitting, in the collab notebooks we learned how exactly to avoid the problem of overfitting or underfitting in a system. We also got to attend Ms.Taniya's technical talk today on how to succeed on technical interviews and how we can prepare ourselves and what steps we should take when going in for these interviews.
