# FutureMakers2022

Day 1 - Starting off day one of the MIT Surestart machine learning and AI program was fun. I got to meet my teammates and get a little lesson/overview on the basics of python. On Day 1 of the homework, I struggled with a couple of questions because I am quite new to python as I only learned the basics by myself about a week ago. I hope by the end of this program, I can create something great out of python and be able to go back and know how to solve those programs.


Day 2- Today was a day of learning concepts that were completly new to me and it was interesting and challenging to be introduced to these new topics. I got to learn the differen fundementals of machine learning and even though today's homework was slighty confusing, I think the more I read and researched, the more I got to understand the concepts we learned today. 


Day 3- I got to learn a lot of new concepts today and particulary about machine learning. In the homework, I was introduced to different machine learning models and different patterns that I might come across in the future. I was also introduced to a little bit of tensorflow and after today I realized I have so much left to learn. 


Day 4- Today we got to attend a seminar with Dr.David Kong who taught us the significance of story-telling and how it can really have an impact on other readers/your audience. I really enjoyed getting to attend this seminar and it was really fun to hear everyone's origin stories as well as share my own. It was very easy to be engaged because Mr.Kong made it really interactive and fun. I am very inspired after today seminar. 

Day 5- I got to explore more about the new concepts of machine learning, specifically more about neural networks which was very exciting. I got to learn about tensorflow in the homework and I was eager to learn about why and when we use tensorflow. I got to see how neural networks process information and what the output would be. We also got to attend a technical talk today which introduced a different mindset and gave me inspiration. 

Day 6- Today we got to learn more about neural networks and different things like parameters, sigmoid vs softmax, forward and backward passes, etc. We talked about the different layers of a neural network and how to encorporate weight. There was more math presented in today and I'm definetly more challenged as I continue to learn. 


Day 7- I got to learn a lot more about neural networks today and things are for sure getting challenging! There are so many different type of neural networks such as convolution neural networks and Artificial neural networks that handels information differently and processes information differently. I learned quite a lot from today's lesson. We also got to attend a technical talk about setting a goal and completing the steps to acheive that goal. 


Day 8- Today we learned about a new concept called algorithmic bias, which explains how even a computer/computational thinking can also be biased. It was really suprising to learn that computers can be bias but in the end of the lesson it made sense on why. We also attended another relfection session today which refreshed my mind on the 4 steps of computational thinking and how the skills we are learning can apply to my future.
